  //  - What does each config do?
  //    - entity_regex: The regex to match the entity name. It can be a single entity name (e.g. minecraft:zombie) or a regular expression (e.g. minecraft.*)
  //    - direct_kill: If true, the event will only execute on direct kill from the boss. If false, it will instead search for nearby bosses in a radius. Performance may be impacted when false.
  //    - indirect_radius: If direct_kill is false, this is the radius to search for nearby bosses.
  //    - minimum_hp: The minimum health the entity must have to be considered a boss. This is useful when doing a regex of all entities from a mod, to avoid applying ultimatums to normal mobs.
  //    - healing_events: A list of healing events that will be applied to the boss when it dies.
  //  - What does a healing event do?
  //   Healing events are a series of actions that will be applied based on a few conditions you set.
  //    - health_gain_per_death: The amount of health the boss will gain when a nearby player dies. This happes every time and is affected by the difficulty and minimum_hp conditions, but it's not part of the ultimatum.
  //    - ultimatum_death_count: The amount of times the boss must die to perform the ultimatum event.
  //    - ultimatum_heals_maxhp: If true, the ultimatum_death_healing value will be set to max health.
  //    - ultimatum_death_healing: The amount of health the boss will gain when it dies the amount of times set in ultimatum_death_count. If ultimatum_heals_maxhp is set, then the value should be from 0 to 1, so 0.50 would be 50% of the max health.
  //    - require_difficulty: If true, the ultimatum will only be applied if the difficulty is in the list of difficulties.
  //    - difficulty: A list of difficulties that the ultimatum will be applied to. The difficulties are: easy, normal, hard. Hardcore is technically hard too, but in hardcore players will die permanently so it's a bit redundant.
  //    - remove_boss_instead_of_healing: If true, the boss will be removed instead of healing, so it'd completely disappear, forcing the player to resummon or look for another boss.
